Import wait_random from the
previous python file that youâ€™ve
written and write an async routine
called wait_n that takes in 2 int
arguments (in this order): n and
max_delay. You will spawn wait_random
n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of
all the delays (float values).
The list of the delays should be
in ascending order without using
sort() because of concurrency.
